# Manage Resources of Teams and Fleet Namespaces with Config Sync

[Fleet team management] provides a way to configure Namespaces and RBAC
resources at the scope level.
[Config Sync] extends this capability, allowing for the configuration of
additional namespace-scoped resources at the scope level.

Here is an example of a Fleet with two team scopes: `backend` and `frontend`.

The `backend` scope includes two memberships: `us-east-cluster` and
`us-west-cluster`, while the `frontend` scope includes three memberships:
`us-east-cluster`, `us-west-cluster` and `us-central-cluster`.

The `backend` scope is associated with two Namespaces: `bookstore` and
`shoestore`, while the `frontend` scope is linked to two Fleet Namespaces:
`frontend-a` and `frontend-b`.

To apply a NetworkPolicy to all Namespaces bound to the `backend` scope,
and a ResourceQuota to all Namespaces bound to the `frontend` scope, the Fleet
management team can configure a source of truth with additional resources, for
example: [fleet-tenancy/config](config).

## Prerequisite

1. Terraform CLI is installed as this user guide leverages Terraform to
   configure resources.
2. The source of truth is created. If not, use the public [example](config)
   as a quickstart.
3. A fleet host project already exists.
4. Use ACM version 1.17.0 or later.

## 1. [Set up your fleet]

This step includes the following operations:
- Create a Fleet in a project
- Enable API services

Terraform configs: [link](terraform/1-fleet).

Apply the resources via Terraform: [README.md](terraform/1-fleet/README.md).

Notes:
- You may need to run this command multiple times to get all resources created
  successfully due to internal dependencies.

## 2. Configure fleet-level defaults for Config Sync

This step configures fleet-level defaults to install Config Sync on entire
fleet, which syncs [fleet tenancy configs](config) to all clusters in the fleet.

Fleet tenancy configs include the following:
- Two NamespaceSelector objects with the [dynamic mode], one for the `frontend`
  team scope, and the other one for the `backend` team scope. In the dynamic
  mode, NamespaceSelector selects both statically-declared Namespaces and those
  dynamically present on the clusters with matching labels. For more details,
  see [Limit which namespaces a config affects].
- One `ResourceQuota` object that is synced to all [fleet namespaces] of the
  team scope `frontend`.
- One `NetworkPolicy` object that is synced to all fleet namespaces of the team
  scope `backend`.

Terraform configs: [link](terraform/2-fleet-default-config).

Apply the resources via Terraform: [README.md](terraform/2-fleet-default-config/README.md).

Notes:
- The fleet-level defaults must be created before clusters are registered to the
  fleet. The default config wonâ€™t apply to previously registered clusters.

## 3. Create and register clusters

This step creates and registers clusters. For simplicity, we use GKE clusters
and register them for the same project as the fleet.

Terraform configs: [link](terraform/3-clusters).

Apply the resources via Terraform: [README.md](terraform/3-clusters/README.md).

## 4. Configure Fleet Scopes and Namespaces

This step includes the following operations:
- Create team scopes: `backend` and `frontend`
- Add clusters to scopes
- Create fleet Namespaces

Terraform configs: [link](terraform/4-scopes-and-namespaces).

Apply the resources via Terraform: [README.md](terraform/4-scopes-and-namespaces/README.md).

After fleet scopes and Namespaces are created, Config Sync automatically detects
new Namespaces with the associated scope, selects resources in the fleet
Namespaces and reconciles them.

So far, the `NetworkPolicy` object should be applied to all Namespaces bound to
the `backend` scope, and the `ResourceQuota` object should be applied to all
Namespaces bound to the `frontend` scope.

![](images/fleet-tenancy-resources.png)

All scopes share the same source of truth. If you want to sync more sources, you
can add configurations to the source repository with the correct
NamespaceSelector annotation. Config Sync will automatically reconcile those
resources.

Fleet resources are dynamically synced to fleet Namespaces in team scopes.
- When a cluster is removed from a scope, resources in the scope should be
  pruned from the cluster.
- When a fleet Namespace is deleted, resources in that Namespace should be
  pruned from the cluster.

## Cleanup

- Delete Fleet Scopes and Namespaces
- Unregister and delete clusters
- Delete Fleet default member config
- Disable services

To clean up, you can iterate through each terraform config directory in the
reverse order and run the `terraform destroy` command with your GCP project.
